            A company on a journey to simplify playing the lottery in groups.

        <h6>
            The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation implemented their own version of this application validating the need, but at the same time rendering this one obsolete. Code never left the development servers.

        <h1>The Service</h1>
        <p>LotteryPals.com would allow users to buy and track their lottery tickets online, and more importantly, would simplify the process of creating, managing and joining groups. </p>


        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>I led the design of the application from an idea to a functional product.</p>
        <p>I documented user requirements, created use cases and information architecture, designed workflows, graphics, interaction and participated in the actual implementation of the product.</p>

        <h1>Discovery</h1>

        <p>The problem at hand had two major sides to consider - how lottery players are organizing themselves into groups and what was the legally correct way to do it. These two were not always the same.</p>

        <p>I learned that lottery players who manage groups that play together have the following pains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collecting money</li>
            <li>Scanning tickets and distributing copies</li>
            <li>Skipping draws</li>
            <li>Distributing small winnings, free plays, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The group members and the ones wanting to join a group had a different set of problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Missing payments (due to time off work for example)</li>
            <li>Difficulty to opt out occasionally</li>
            <li>Finding groups to join</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp imposes strict rules for playing in groups that a company would be required to follow.</p>
        <p>Finally, the company needed modern web presence how they would sign up new players. Here the goal is to explain the business model in simple terms while gaining the customer's trust. </p>
        <p>With all this information I could create profiles for each identified user type (public, regular players, group managers, system administrators) and feature sets required by each user type and get a rough idea on how to present this in a self-explanatory way.</p>
        <h1>Definition</h1>
        <p>The application is a heavily data-driven one. Different user types would exist, each with different capabilities. For that, I had to create a user-privilege matrix that I used to create the site maps and user workflows.</p>
        <p>The two major components would be the public part of the web application and the member's portal. </p>

        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>Due to the nature of the application, it was imperative that users would be left with both a sense of security and playfulness from the very beginning. This project was happening right around the time when all
        lottery and gambling websites in the US were getting shut down, so of utmost importance was to create a user experience that would instill confidence in the players.</p>
        <blockquote>
            Gaining the trust of the customer is infinitely easier than regaining it.
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Influencing feelings, changing perceptions</h3>
        <p>Research has shown that users perceive a well-built, precise and accurate UI as more secure. So the goal is to deliver exactly that - a professionally designed and built application with attention to detail paid to every pixel, every click, every bit of information on the screen. There could not be any room for doubt.</p>
        <p>For added sense of security, I went above and beyond to remove possibilities for mistakes from all workflows. Every action was to be confirmed unless the user requested not to, and every action was to be reversible directly by the user.</p>
        <p>To achieve playfulness I used a vibrant color scheme and relevant graphics.</p>

        <h3>Simplicity</h3>
        <p>The value proposition for target users was the alleviated pain that comes with playing the lottery in groups
            and the ability to buy tickets from the comfort of their homes. LotteryPals.com could not be the source any new pain.</p>
        <p>To improve the user experience for users of all technical skill levels and across a variety of devices, each workflow and each
            entry form was designed for simplicity and error prevention. Depending on the context, visual elements like sliders,
            calendar widgets and toggle switches were used to replace traditional data entry fields. Additionally, extensive field validation was created to allow for early error detection. </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>A major design challenge was maintaining balance between a UI that instills confidence and security (the norm being very rigid online banking applications) and one that suggests playfulness.</p>
        <p>To overcome, a simple 3-color scheme was created and colors were used to highlight web elements, while keeping most of the content on a simple white background. </p>

        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <h3>Don't guess what the users want</h3>
        <p>... ask them!</p>
        <p>User interviews are invaluable tool. They provide validation to some ideas and completely shatter others. It is those users that will drive the business however, so when an idea is shattered, pick up the pieces and make it better. </p>
        <h3>Stop planning and start doing</h3>
        <p>No amount of pre-planning will yield a perfect solution the first time. Refining the product through iteration will happen no matter what, so the sooner it starts, the better. Get a good understanding of what is to be built, and start building it.</p>
        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>As some of the best products out there, LotteryPals.com was created out of a real need to simplify a task that most people do. Even though
            the project got shut down before it ever launched, proper user centered design methodologies were used during the design
            what resulted in a web application that excelled at the tasks it set out to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>It was a great journey and an awesome learning experience, one that has helped me many times since.</p>
