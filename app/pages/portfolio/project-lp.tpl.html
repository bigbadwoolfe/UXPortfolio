            A company on a journey to simplify playing the lottery in groups.
        </h3>
        <h6>
            The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation implemented their own version of this application validating the need, but at the same time rendering this one obsolete. Code never left the development servers.

        <h1>The Service</h1>
        <p>LotteryPals.com would allow users to buy and track their lottery tickets online, and more importantly, would simplify the process of creating, managing and joining groups. </p>


        <h1>My Role</h1>
        <p>I led the design of the application from an idea to a functional product.</p>
        <p>I documented user requirements, created use cases and information architecture, designed workflows, graphics, interaction and participated in the actual implementation of the product.</p>

        <h1>Discovery</h1>

        <p>The problem at hand had two major sides to consider - how lottery players are organizing themselves into groups and what was the legally correct way to do it. These two were not always the same.</p>

        <p>I learned that lottery players who manage groups that play together have the following pains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collecting money</li>
            <li>Scanning tickets and distributing copies</li>
            <li>Skipping draws</li>
            <li>Distributing small winnings, free plays, etc</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The group members and the ones wanting to join a group had a different set of problems:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Missing payments (due to vacations)</li>
            <li>Difficulty to opt out occasionally</li>
            <li>Finding groups to join</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp imposes strict rules for playing in groups that a company would be required to follow.</p>
        <p>Finally, the company needed modern web presence how they would sign up new players. Here the goal is to explain the business model in simple terms while gaining the customer's trust. </p>
        <p>With all this information I could create profiles for each identified user type (public, regular players, group managers, system administrators) and feature sets required by each user type and get a rough idea on how to present this in a self-explanatory way.</p>
        <h1>Definition</h1>
        <p>The application is a heavily data-driven one. Different user types would exist, each with different capabilities. For that, I had to create a user-privilege matrix, and once I had that, create the site maps and user workflows.</p>
        <p>The two major components would be the public part of the web application and the member's portal. </p>

        <h1>Design</h1>
        <p>Due to the nature of the application, it was imperative that users would be left with both a sense of security and playfulness from the very beginning.</p>
        <blockquote>
            "You never get a second chance to make a first impression."
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Influencing user feelings</h3>
        <p>To address the security feeling, I needed to show a professionally designed and built application. Everything had to be air-tight and consistent throughout the application. This includes layout elements, messages and content. There could not be any room for doubt.</p>
        <p>To protect the user, possibilities for mistakes were eliminated as much as possible from all workflows. The users were further reassured by confirming actions and they were given the ability to undo any action for a period of time.</p>
        <p>To achieve playfulness I used vibrant colors and relevant graphics that pop off the background.</p>
        <p>The challenge was to keep a good balance between feeling secure and feeling playful, as these two often do not go hand in hand.</p>

        <h3>Simplicity</h3>
        <p>Users were expected to join to alleviate pain. This application mustn't create any new one.</p>
        <p>All data entry forms were simplified and heavily contextual. Logical ranges and visual elements to aid the information exchange were created. </p>

        <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
        <h3>Don't guess what the users want</h3>
        <p>... ask them!</p>
        <p>User interviews are invaluable tool. They provide validation to some ideas and completely shatter others. It is those users that will drive the business however, so when an idea is shattered, pick up the pieces and make it better. </p>
        <h3>Stop planning and start doing</h3>
        <p>No amount of pre-planning will yield a perfect solution the first time. Refining the product through iteration will happen no matter what, so the sooner it starts, the better. Get a good understanding of what is to be built, and start building it.</p>
