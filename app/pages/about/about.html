                I have been improving the user experience of web applications for more than 10 years and currently I am a <em>Lead UX Designer</em> for <a href="https://www.geotab.com" target="_blank" title="Geotab, Inc">GEOTAB</a>, a global telematics leader (telematics is the part of IT dealing with GPS tracking of vehicles).
            </p>
            <p>
                My daily tasks are mainly consisted of identifying usability problems with the company’s web applications, researching and designing solutions for those problems and managing the implementation. I interact daily with teams of developers and marketing specialists, product owners and the highest levels of management within the company. My goal is to not allow a new feature to be created without it being thoroughly thought out and seen with the eyes of the users, while at the same time gradually improve the UX of the entire application by changing everything from the tone in which the application speaks to it’s users to overhauling counter-intuitive workflows. I am constantly advocating for the end user by mentoring the development, design and marketing teams on best practises for UX on a regular basis. Being a developer by trade, I also occasionally hands-on implement features that go into the product.

                Before this, I was a <em>Team Lead and Front End Technical Lead</em> at <a href="https://www.theredpin.com" target="_blank" title="TheRedPin, Brokerage">TheRedPin</a>, a technology startup. Here I sharpened my leadership skills and learned that great leaders aren’t managers, but facilitators who drive teams and products to success by guiding the team members to achieve their own goals.

                I feel I excel the most at analyzing and optimizing user interfaces and creating easy-to-use and pleasant web applications that work equally well across the full spectrum of devices they can be used on. I hold a <em>degree in computer science</em> from University of Toronto. I also spend hours each week educating myself and keeping up to date with the current usability principles and design trends. Feel free to check out my <a>resume</a>.

                When I'm not working, I'm likely spending time with my wife and 3 year old daughter, or I'm preparing for my next archery tournament.
