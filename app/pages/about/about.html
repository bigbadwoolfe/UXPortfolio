            <p>For the better part of the last year I have been a <em>Team Lead</em>  and a <em> Front End Development Tech Lead</em> for <a href="https://www.theredpin.com" target="_blank">TheRedPin Inc</a>, a technology start-up in Toronto.</p>

            <p>My daily tasks are mainly consisted of overlooking and participating in the development and UX design of the company's main web site, which is a complex web application with many thousands of daily users. I am also mentoring a team of developers and UX designers on development and UX best practises daily.</p>

            <p>Before that I was the <em>UX Lead Designer and Web Developer</em> at <a href="http://www.seagate.com" target="_blank">Seagate Technology</a>.
                Here I led major redesign efforts for several products and designed the user interface for dozens of features that were integrated with already existing products.
                I also led the design of two brand new web products and an online store for the company.
                When I was not involved in hands-on design, I overlooked the UX on several projects and mentored less experienced developers and designers, as well as created, maintained and enforced UI standards for the products I had designed.</p>
            </p>

            <p>My specialty are responsive user interfaces for web applications. I hold a <em>degree in computer science </em>from University of Toronto. I also spend hours each week educating myself and keeping up to date with the current usability principles and design trends. </p>

            <p>
                When I'm not working, I'm likely spending time with my wife and 4 year old daughter, or I'm preparing for my next archery tournament.
