            <p>
                I have been improving the user experience of web applications for more than 10 years. Currently I lead the improvement of the user experience across several web and mobile applications for <a href="https://www.geotab.com" target="_blank" title="Geotab, Inc">GEOTAB</a>, a global telematics leader.
            </p>
            <p>
                My daily tasks are mainly consisted of identifying usability problems with the companyâ€™s web applications, researching and designing solutions for those problems with the team and managing their implementation.
                Within the company I interact daily with teams of developers, marketing specialists, product owners and the highest levels of management. I also have frequent interaction with the end users and partners who provide user training.
            </p>
            <p>
                My goal is to not allow a new feature to be created without it being thoroughly thought out and seen through the eyes of the end users,
                while at the same time introduce incremental changes to the existing applications that will eventually fulfill my vision; a set of intuitive, pleasant and modern applications that all provide identical user experience.
            </p>
            <p>I am constantly advocating for the end user by mentoring the development, design and marketing teams on best practises for UX on a regular basis. Being a developer by trade, I also participate in hands-on implementation of the features the team designs.</p>
            <p>
                Before this, I was a <em>Team Lead and Front End Technical Lead</em> at <a href="https://www.theredpin.com" target="_blank" title="TheRedPin, Brokerage">TheRedPin</a>, a technology startup. Here I successfully led a team of developers, quality assurance engineers and designers to many successful product releases, in the process greatly sharpening my leadership skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am confident I excel at both leading teams to, and hands-on analyze and optimize user interfaces and create easy-to-use and pleasant web applications that work equally well across the full spectrum of devices they can be used on. I hold a <em>degree in computer science</em> from University of Toronto. I also spend hours each week educating myself and keeping up to date with the current usability principles and design trends.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, when I'm not working, I'm likely spending time with my wife and 4 year old daughter, or I'm preparing for my next archery tournament.
