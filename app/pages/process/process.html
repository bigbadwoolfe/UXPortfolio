            <p>My design process, much like my designs themselves, is simple and effective. It is a framework that I most often follow closely, but it also leaves me room for improvisation if required by a project.</p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <h4>I learn everything I can about the users, the functionality and who I am up against.</h4>
            <p>
                Based on the information acquired in the pre-discovery meetings, this when I create user profiles, digest the required product functionality and do competitive analysis. I look for obstacles and I brainstorm ideas for possible solutions to the same. This is where post-it notes come in handy.
            </p>

            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <h4>I decide what will work and what will not.</h4>
            <p>With the knowledge of the discovery phase I can now firmly lay out the information architecture and the feature capabilities. This is where the use cases are turned into workflow diagrams. </p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <h4>I wireframe, iterate, prototype, iterate, mock up, iterate, iterate some more and then deliver.</h4>
            <p>
                The rest of the world thinks that this is when the meaningful work begins.
            </p>
            <p>
                I start with a low fidelity wireframes. Something done quickly on paper or using Balsamiq. This will be the first materialization of everything the decision makers and product owners have been talking about.
            </p>
            <p>
                After sanity is confirmed on those, I create a low to medium fidelity prototypes that now resemble the real product. Elements are shown in true size for all viewport sizes required. Some basic interactivity exists and users can now start clicking, but at this point the focus is still the workflow, not the fine interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                With feedback received on the prototypes, I now create a fully functional data driven mock ups. They have everything the prototypes do, with a lot more interactivity (validation, transitions, etc). At this point the design is starting to resemble the actual product to be implemented and upon approval, a development team can start working against it.
            </p>
            <p>
                If requested, I produce production quality layouts, stylesheets and scripts that can be used to bootstrap the development of the project.
            </p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <h4>I ensure my designs perform as expected.</h4>
            <p>If project timelines allow, upon project completion I do usability testing where I ensure the actual users got what they expected rather than what a product owner thought they expected.</p>
