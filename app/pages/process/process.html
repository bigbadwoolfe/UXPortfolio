            <p>My design process, much like my designs themselves, is simple and effective. It is a framework that I most often follow closely, but it also leaves room for improvisation if ever required.</p>

            <h2>Discovery</h2>
            <h4>I learn everything I can about the users, the functionality and who I am up against.</h4>
            <p>
                Based on the information acquired in the pre-discovery meetings, this is when I do user and competitive analysis, create user profiles and digest the
                required product functionality. I look for obstacles and I brainstorm ideas for possible solutions to the same.
            </p>

            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <h4>I decide what will work, what will not and what will need to be fixed before it works.</h4>
            <p>With knowledge from the discovery phase, the information architecture can be laid down firmly. Use case diagrams, site maps, workflow diagrams are all created here. By the end of this phase all functionality is described in great detail.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <h4>I wireframe, iterate, prototype, iterate, mock up, iterate, iterate some more and then deliver.</h4>
            <p>
                To the rest of the world, this is when the actual work begins.
            </p>
            <p>
                I start with a storyboard made of low fidelity wireframes. Something done quickly on paper or using a tool like Balsamiq. The storyboards are the first visualization that stakeholders see of what has been discussed to this point.
            </p>
            <p>
                After sanity is confirmed and feedback has been worked in, I create a low to medium fidelity prototypes that now vaguely resemble the real product. Elements are shown in true size and the designs are tested across all required screen sizes.
                Some basic interactivity exists; users can now start clicking, but at this point the focus is still on digitizing storyboards as accurately as possible, and not on the details of the interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the feedback from the prototypes, I create fully functional data driven mock ups. They have everything the prototypes do, with a lot more interactivity and attention to detail. At this point the design offers the full functionality like the real product would. The only thing missing is the 'make-up'. A development team can now start laying the UI infrastructure against it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final part of the design stage includes the graphic design and fine tuning of the interactions. I often create a rendering of the product in Photoshop (or similar) and attempt to recreate a design as close to that with HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                When necessary, I do a more extensive HTML/CSS/Javascript work and create production quality layouts, stylesheets and scripts that can be used to bootstrap the development of the project.
            </p>

            <h2>Evaluation</h2>
            <h4>I ensure my designs perform as expected.</h4>
            <p>When project timelines allow, I do usability testing upon project completion. I ensure the users got what they truly expected and nothing was lost in translation.</p>
            <p>I give users specific tasks and observe them interacting with the application.
                'Thinking aloud' is encouraged, as is talking about the decisions made with respect to the application.</p>

            <p>As part of my evaluation, feedback is also collected and analyzed.</p>
